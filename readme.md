Source for [Splinesoft.net](https://splinesoft.net), a purveyor of finely-crafted bits for iPhone and iPad.

### Architecture

Splinesoft.net is a static site...

- Generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- Hosted on [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Amazon Cloudfront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) for great uptime and incredibly low cost
- With a free SSL certificate from [AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) for HTTPS

### Running Locally

It's super easy to build the site and test it locally:

```
jekyll serve --watch
```

### Publishing

The site is deployed to S3 by CircleCI, using [s3cmd](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd), a handy command-line tool for S3.

### Thanks!
